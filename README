Description:
You can read the description from the provided pdf.

The header file matrix.h defines a class Matrix that works with the type float. The class supports 
the following operations on the matrices:
1)transpose
2)addition
3)subtraction
4)multiplication
5)negation
6)submatrix


We can directly use the iostream objects with the Matrix type objects to initialize and print the matrix,
this has been taken care of in our program.

Running Instructions: A makefile has been provided with all the necessary targets and their dependencies
To test the progra, I have included a driver file main.cpp. One can test the program by just running "make run"
in the bash terminal. It will automatically compile the .cpp files and link them to create an executable, and 
will also run it.

Notes and Assumption:

1)Our program allows the creation of a deep copy of a matrix using the copy constructor.

2)It is also possible to pass an array to populate the matrix.

3)Our program allocates and deallocates memory from the heap on its own. Hence, there are no memory leaks.
