Weekly Exercise 4

Included Files:
1) Makefile
2) README
3) matrix.h
4) matrix.cpp

Description:

The Targets included in the Makefile are:
	make clean: removes all the object files and the executables
	make matrix.o: matrix.cpp
	
The header file matrix.h defines a class Matrix that works with the type float. The class supports 
the following operations on the matrices:
1)transpose
2)addition
3)subtraction
4)multiplication
5)negation
6)submatrix

We can directly use the iostream objects with the Matrix type objects to initialize and print the matrix,
this has been taken care of in our program.

Notes and Assumption:

1)Our program allows the creation of a deep copy of a matrix using the copy constructor.

2)It is also possible to pass an array to populate the matrix.

3)Our program allocates and deallocates memory from the heap on its own. Hence, there are no memory leaks.
